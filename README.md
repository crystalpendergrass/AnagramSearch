Assignment #5 for CPSC2108 [Data Structures]

This assignment was to help familiarize us with using hash tables as a data structure.  

For this assignment, I borrowed code from assignment 3 to sort the dictionary alphabetically as required by the assignment.  Collisions were resolved using chaining because it was easier for me to group anagrams together and then print them.
